# Smart Home Controller 🚪💡🌐

A microcontroller-based Smart Home Controller project built using Keil µVision and embedded C. The system allows automation and control of home appliances via a centralized controller.

## 🔧 Features

- Control of multiple home appliances
- Timer-based operation
- Real-time status feedback
- Embedded system design using ARM/8051 (based on your MCU)
- Circuit schematic included

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Open `SMART HOME CONTROLLER PROJECT.uvprojx` in **Keil µVision**.
2. Connect your microcontroller development board.
3. Compile and flash the `Project code1.c` onto the board.
4. Refer to `SCHEMATIC DIAGRAM.jpg` for hardware connections.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Keil µVision IDE
- Supported microcontroller (e.g., STM32/8051)
- Embedded C compiler
- Hardware setup (relays, sensors, etc.)
